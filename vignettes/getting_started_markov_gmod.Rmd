The purpose of this vignette is to provide a step by step guide to illustrate the main features of gmod for markov modeling:

* think about the structure of gom by adopting a unified sequence of events
* structure of gmod of decision -> makrov states -> event1 -> event2 -> ... -> last events
* definitions: 
  * states
  * events
  * final outcomes
  * intermediate outcomes
  * payoffs 
* distinguishing between states and events
* examining the resulting equations and formulae
* adding discounting factors
* adding events
* accessing prior (upstream event values)
* adding states
